            <h3>Jules Agent Update: Faster, Smarter, More Reliable</h3>
            <p class="date">June 20, 2025</p>
            <p>Jules environment updates</p>
            <p>We’ve shipped a big upgrade to the Jules agent under the hood.</p>
            <h4>What’s new:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Smarter context. Jules reads from AGENTS.md if it’s in your repo.</li>
                <li>Improved performance. Tasks now complete faster—no numbers to share just yet, but you’ll feel it.</li>
                <li>Significantly reduced punting. We tightened the loop to keep Jules moving forward.</li>
                <li>More reliable setup. If you’ve added an environment setup script, Jules now runs it consistently.</li>
                <li>Better test habits. Jules is more likely to write and run tests on its own.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Check out the <a href="https://jules.google/docs/">Getting Started guide</a> to learn more about AGENTS.md support.</p>

            <h3>Modernized base environment and updated toolchains</h3>
            <p class="date">June 18, 2025</p>
            <p>Jules environment updates</p>
            <p>We’ve overhauled the Jules development environment to move beyond the default Ubuntu 24.04 LTS packages. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Explicitly installing newer versions of key toolchains like Rust, Node, and Python, addressing long-standing version issues.</li>
                <li>Adding finer-grained control over installation steps via custom scripts instead of relying solely on apt.</li>
                <li>Introducing support for multiple runtimes, improved isolation, and version pinning to reduce drift and better match developer expectations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>These changes unblock several issues developers encountered with outdated dependencies and improve alignment with modern project requirements.</p>

            <h3>A faster, smoother and more reliable Jules</h3>
            <p class="date">May 30, 2025</p>
            <p>This week, our focus has been on improving reliability, fixing our GitHub integration, and scaling capacity.</p>
            <h4>Here’s what’s we shipped:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Updated our limits to 60 tasks per day, 5 concurrent.</li>
                <li>We substantially improved the reliability of the GitHub sync. Export to GitHub should also be fixed on previously created tasks.</li>
                <li>We’ve decreased the number of failure cases by 2/3</li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <li>Upgraded our queuing system and added more compute to reduce wait times during peak usage</li>
                <li>Publish Branch button is now part of the summary UI in the activity feed so it’s easier to find</li>
                <li>Bug vixes for task status and mobile</li>

            <h3>Jules is here</h3>
            <p class="date">May 19, 2025</p>
            <p>Jules dashboard</p>
            <p>Today, we’re launching <a href="https://jules.google.com/">Jules</a>, a new AI coding agent.</p>
            <p>Jules helps you move faster by working asynchronously on tasks in your GitHub repo. It can fix bugs, update dependencies, migrate code, and add new features.</p>
            <p>Once you give Jules a task, it spins up a fresh dev environment in a VM, installs dependencies, writes tests, makes the changes, runs the tests, and opens a pull request. Jules shows its work as it makes progress, so you never have to guess what code it’s writing, or what it’s thinking.</p>
            <h4>What Jules can do today</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Fix bugs with test verified patches</li>
                <li>Handle version bumps and dependency upgrades</li>
                <li>Perform scoped code transformations</li>
                <li>Migrate code across languages or frameworks</li>
                <li>Ship isolated, scoped, features</li>
                <li>Open PRs with runnable code and test results</li>
            </ul>
